# IMDB-Search-Engine
This is an application that will parse through IMDB's site data and return relevant information based on a user's search.  Users can search for keywords to find movies and be presented with movie info, and can search for actors/actresses to get their career info.

NOTE: The data files cannot be uploaded to github because they exceed the 25MB limit.
